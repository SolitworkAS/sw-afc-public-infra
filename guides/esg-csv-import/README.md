   - In Notepad, click on `File` -> `Save As`.

## Frequently asked questions

### Q: Can I change the format of the CSV file?
**A:** No, its not possible to upload in any other format than the one specified

### Q: What happens if I upload a file containing transactions with already existing ID's?
**A:** The file will be uploaded and will not generate an error. The transactions with the already existing ID's will not be uploaded or changed in any way. The reason for allowing files with existing ID's is to ease the work done when extracting data from other systems, so that you do not need to check if the file includes data already imported.

## Common issues when preparing and uploading CSV files

### Errors in headers
**Correct Spelling and Capitalization**

Ensure that all header names match the required format exactly, including capitalization and spacing. Even a minor deviation, such as an extra space or incorrect capitalization, will prevent the file from uploading.

**Double-Check Headers**

Before uploading, carefully review all headers to ensure accuracy.

### Data formatting in Excel
**Follow Correct Data Formats â€“ Common Mistakes**

Cells should not be formatted as general.

**Dates must follow the format: yyyy-mm-dd.**

If you are using commas in data values (e.g., in the Amount column as a thousand separator) make sure to enclose those entries with double quotes ("). Commas in entries will interfere with the CSV structure and cause errors during upload.

### Converting excel-file to CSV
**Delimiter Issues**

 When saving Excel files as CSV, some systems default to using a semicolon (;) as the delimiter instead of a comma (,). Our system expects a comma.
   
**Solution**

Open the CSV file in Notepad, press Ctrl + F to find all semicolons, and replace them with commas.

### File encoding:
**Files must be saved in UTF-8 format, not UTF-8 with BOM.**

Open the file in Notepad, save it with the encoding option set to "UTF-8."

### Hidden characters:
**Some Excel versions may introduce hidden characters during the conversion to CSV.**

Use a tool like Notepad++ to visualize and remove any hidden characters.

### Uploading the CSV file
**Authorization**

Ensure you are authorized to upload the file before proceeding. Authorization expires quickly, so complete the upload promptly after authorization.

**File Verification**

Double-check the CSV file for formatting issues before uploading.
